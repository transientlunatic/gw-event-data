# Blueprint for 256s bilby ROQ jobs
# ---
# This blueprint file will provide the settings required to run the bilby pipeline using an ROQ likelihood.
#
# Notes
# -----
# If you wish to apply this blueprint directly without changes you'll need to already have a bayeswave job in your project which is called "Bayeswave".
# If your bayeswave job is called something else then you'll need to update "Bayeswave" to its actual name under the "needs" section so that the PSDs are found successfully.
